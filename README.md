## Project Description

This project was inspired by the [How to Handle Imbalanced Data in Machine Learning Classification](https://www.justintodata.com/imbalanced-data-machine-learning-classification/) article from authors of https://www.justintodata.com.

The goal of the project is to understand how to handle and mitigate imbalanced datasets in order to build classification models. When we talk about imbalanced data sets in machine learning we are usually talking about situations were the _label_ or _classes_ of a dataset are not distributed equally. A very common example in Machine Learning (ML) literature is if we want to predict Postivie Cancer diagnosis. Here we have two classes: Postive Cancer Diagnosis, (Cancer) and Negative Cancer Diagnosis (No Cancer). In such data sets, the number of positive cancer diagnosis are much less than negative or non-cancer diagnosis -- the data set classes are imbalanced.

**Majority class** - is the more common label in a class-imbalanced dataset. For example, given a dataset containing 99% negative labels and 1% positive labels, the negative labels are the majority class, just like our cancer diagnosis example

**Minority class** - is the less common label in a class-imbalanced dataset. For example, given a dataset containing 99% negative labels and 1% positive labels, the positive labels are the minority class.

If we just apply imbalanced data directly into a machine learning algorithm, we are going to run into problems. The model no doubt will ignore the minority class as there are so few examples to train on in comparison to the majority class, so expect incorrect predictions for the underrepresented class. These erroneous predictions are especially bad if what we really care about predicting correctly is the minority class like in our cancer diagnosis example.

### What this Project Does Specifically

The project:

- Loads and inspects and imbalanced data set
- Performs various methods to make the data set either more balanced or at least weighted to handle the imblances
- Builds various binary classifiers from the rebalanced or weighted data sets
- Evaluates the performance of each classifier using an Area Under the Receiver-Operating Characteris (ROC) Curve [(AUC)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#AUC) score.

---

## Objective

The project contains the key elements:

- `Area Under the Receiver-Operating Characteris (ROC) Curve [(AUC)]` scoreing for classifer identification,
- `Git` (version control),
- `imblearn` Python library to perform oversampling and undersampling,
- `Jupyter` Python coded notebooks,
- `Numpy` for arrays and numerical operations,
- `Pandas` for dataframe usage,
- `Python` the standard modules,
- `SMOTE` to help with oversampling,
- `Scikit-Learn` to get training and test datasets,
- `Tomek` to help with undersampling,
- `uv` package management including use of `ruff` for linting and formatting
